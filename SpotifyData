** First, I created a data table in SQLlite and then imported Spotify data from 2021 **
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )


** Next, I got familiar with the newly input data with a general select query **
select * from spotifydata


** I then determined the top 10 songs and corresponding artists based on popularity **
select artist_name, track_name, popularity from spotifydata 
order by popularity desc
limit 10


** Next, I determined which artists released the 5 longest tracks in the top 50 **
select artist_name, track_name from spotifydata
order by duration_ms desc
limit 5


** I then used SQL to calculate the average danceability of the 10 most popular songs **
select sum(danceability)/10 from spotifydata 
where id >=1 and id <=10


** Next, I determined the average popularity, danceability, and energy of each artist **
select artist_name, avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(energy) 
from spotifydata 
group by artist_name


** Next, I used a CTE to create a temporary table in order to determine and display the name and popularity of every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above and tagging them as "Top Star" **
with topstar as(
select artist_name, avg(spotifydata.popularity) as average_popularity
from spotifydata 
group by artist_name)

select artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' as tag from topstar
where average_popularity >= 90
order by average_popularity desc
